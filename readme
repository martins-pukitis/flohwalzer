Flohwalzer implementation on Tivaâ„¢ C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Board.

Plays Flohwalzer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flohwalzer) in forwards or backwards direction depending on the button pressed.

******* Required Hardware I/O connections*******************
play flohwalzer in forwards direction button connected to PE0
play flohwalzer in backwards direction button connected to PE1
8*R resistor DAC bit 0 on PB0 (least significant bit)
4*R resistor DAC bit 1 on PB1
2*R resistor DAC bit 2 on PB2
1*R resistor DAC bit 3 on PB3 (most significant bit)

Building requires Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Installation instructions on Linux follow.

tar -xf CCS11.0.0.00012_linux-x64.tar.gz
cd CCS11.0.0.00012_linux-x64
Run installation wizard with:
./ccs_setup_11.0.0.00012.run
If installation wizard says there are missing dependencies, read http://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccsv10_linux_host_support.html, fix them and try installation wizard again.
During installation, select "Custom Installation" and in component selection window select TM4C12x ARM Cortex-M4F core-based MCUs.
